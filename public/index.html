    <h1>Send a Message in a Bottle</h1>
    <div class="container">
        <div class="instructions">
            <p>What you write will be tossed out into the endless sea, carried by the currents and received by someone
                else in the future. Whether it is the next person or the one after that, trust that your message will be
                found and read. </p>
            <p>Offer what you wish to share: a confession, a story, a poem, or a wish. But know this—the sea does not
                reveal its secrets. You may never know who finds your message or when it will arrive. Once your words
                are set free, a message will return to you—an anonymous voice, floating back from the tide.</p>
            </p>
            <p>Your message will be shared anonymously with another visitor. Once delivered, it won't be stored or saved
                anywhere.</p>

            <p>Messages are anonymous, but intended to bring warmth, curiosity, or reflection to a stranger. Please
                be kind.</p>
